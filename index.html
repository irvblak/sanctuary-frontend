            seven days of the event date, or at the host’s discretion. Guest

        The members directory will allow residents to share, if they wish,
        their name, email address and (optionally) phone number, together
        with a simple property code such as SM12 or SC07.
      </p>
      <p>
        This directory will be visible only to Sanctuary Club members and will
        respect individual privacy preferences. It is intended to make it
        easier for neighbours to stay in touch socially and around club
        activities.

          <li>
            Each occupant decides what to show: email, phone, or neither.
